# Take the Stairs 2: Glocked and Loaded

What is this game?
------------------
Take the Stairs 2: Glocked and Loaded, sequel to the infamously not-well-known Take the Stairs, is a 3D top-down shooter roguelike that immerses the player into some 
random building filled with circular bad guys with guns. The objective of the game is to survive through various hordes of enemies
to take the stairs. Since this is a roguelike, the game will only end until the player is defeated by the enemies. Luckily, the player
is able to stock up on powerups to help them on their run to take the stairs. From random drop rates to an entire shop ran by a mysteriously
petty shop keeper, Take the Stairs 2: Glocked and Loaded provides mindless entertainment to players who really like walking on stairs and guns.

How to Play!
-------------
Instructions for Take the Stairs 2: Glocked and Loaded are fairly simple and easy to learn! 
- This game uses the classic WASD keys for movement (you can also use the directional keys if you feel like it, though we don't know why you would honestly chose that). 
- To use the main selling point of the game, you use the mouse to rotate the player. This in turn changes how you aim with the gun, 
since the gun is located directly in front of the player. 
- To shoot, simply left-click (you will also see a shot fire to confirm that you have in fact fired a shot). 
- If in the off-chance you run out of bullets or would like to reload early, press the R key to reload*. This will allow you to continue to go ballistic on the enemies.
*side note: since we figured that most people would just be spamming left-click, we decided to auto-refill the gun for you if you keep spamming left-click when the gun is empty,
you are welcome :)
- To check your player stats such as all of the powerups and schmoney you have accumulated, press the C key. This also serves as a pause button too. To return, simply press c again.
- When exploring, you may encounter a shop keeper who sells various (possibly illegal) powerups for schmoney. To buy them, simply press the green button that is right next to
the powerup you would like to buy. The moment you buy it, it is used immediately. The shop keeper will let you know whether you were able to buy it or wasted her time showing 
up to her shop with not enough schmoney.
- You can also encounter powerups in the various rooms you explore. If you see a box for example, **_shoot it_**. You might get something nice...
- Each time you progress through the rooms, enemies will randomly spawn. You will not be able to leave until you defeat them all...or die.
- To progress through the game, you must find and take the stairs. See how far you can go!
